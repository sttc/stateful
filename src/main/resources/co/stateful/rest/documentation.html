<h1>Stateful Web Primitives</h1>

<p>It is a collection of simple web primitives, accessible
through web interface and RESTful API.</p>

<h2>Atomic Counters</h2>

<p>You create an atomic counter with a unique name and set
its initial value. Then, you can change its value, increment
or decrement it. Our server guarantees atomicity of increment/decrement
operation. This means that no matter how many parallel requests you send,
their results will not be duplicated.</p>

<p>This is mechanism may useful when you need to simulate
an auto-increment value in a NoSQL database, for example DynamoDB.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>In every HTTP request you should set two authentication headers
<code>X-Sttc-URN</code> and <code>X-Sttc-Token</code>
to the values you see on top of this page.</p>

<p>For example, this is how your HTTP request may look like:</p>

<pre>GET /c/test/inc?value=0 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.stateful.co
X-Sttc-URN: urn:github:526301
X-Sttc-Token: B28F-38E4-B305-C3A3</pre>

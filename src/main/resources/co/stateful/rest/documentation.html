<h1>Stateful Web Primitives</h1>

<p>Stateful.co is a collection of web primitives, accessible
through web interface and RESTful API.</p>

<h2>Atomic Counters</h2>

<p>You create an atomic counter with a unique name and set
its initial integer value. Then, you can increment
or decrement it. Our server guarantees atomicity of each
operation. This means that no matter how many parallel requests you send,
their results won't be duplicated.</p>

<p>This mechanism may be very useful, when you need to simulate
an auto-increment value in a NoSQL database, for example
Amazon DynamoDB.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>In every HTTP request you should set two authentication headers
<code>X-Sttc-URN</code> and <code>X-Sttc-Token</code>
to the values you see on top of this page.</p>

<p>For example, this is how your HTTP request may look like:</p>

<pre>GET /c/test/inc?value=0 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.stateful.co
X-Sttc-URN: urn:github:526301
X-Sttc-Token: B28F-38E4-B305-C3A3</pre>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

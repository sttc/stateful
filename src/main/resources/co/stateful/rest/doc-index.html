<h1>Stateful Web Primitives</h1>

<p>Stateful.co is a collection of web primitives, accessible
through web interface and RESTful API.</p>

<h2>Atomic Counters</h2>

<p>You create an atomic counter with a unique name and set
its initial integer value. Then, you can increment
or decrement it. Our server guarantees atomicity of each
operation. This means that no matter how many parallel requests you send,
their results won't be duplicated.</p>

<p>This mechanism may be very useful, when you need to simulate
an auto-increment value in a NoSQL database, for example
Amazon DynamoDB.</p>

<h2>Concurrent Locks</h2>

<p>Create a lock, run your sensitive operations, and remove the lock.
We guarantee that lock creation procedure is atomic. This means that
only one process will get a lock, others will be rejected.</p>

<p>This mechanism may be useful to synchronize data modification
processes running across multiple server nodes. Inside one node
you can synchronize through platform-native locking tools, but
in multi-node environment cloud locking is the only option.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>In every HTTP request you should set two authentication headers
<code>X-Sttc-URN</code> and <code>X-Sttc-Token</code>
to the values you see on top of this page.</p>

<p>For example, this is how your HTTP request may look like:</p>

<pre>GET /c/test/inc?value=0 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.stateful.co
X-Sttc-URN: urn:github:526301
X-Sttc-Token: B28F-38E4-B305-C3A3</pre>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>The service is absolutely free of charge, thanks to
our sponsor <a href="http://www.teamed.io">teamed.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions? Ideas?</h2>

<p>It is an open source project, don't hesitate to
tell us what you would like to improve or fix. Just submit
an issue to <a href="https://github.com/sttc/stateful">Github</a>.</p>

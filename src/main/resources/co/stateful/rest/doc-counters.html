<p>
    Counters are accessible through RESTful API. There
    are two operations availables on every counter:
    set and increment.
    Set returns nothing, while increment
    returns current value of the counter.
    In order to read without changing
    you just increment by zero. An increment with
    a negative value will decrement a counter.
</p>

<p>
    For example, in order to set <code>test</code> counter to 123, you
    make a <code>PUT</code> request: <code>/c/test/set?value=123</code>.
    In case of success, HTTP response code will be
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.4">303</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In order to increment the same counter by 54, you
    make a <code>GET</code> request: <code>/c/test/inc?value=123</code>.
    Request header <code>Accept</code> should include <code>text/plain</code>.
    In case of success HTTP response code will be
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.1">200</a>
    and response body
    will contain counter value, in plain text format (integer number).
</p>

<p>
    Maximum number of digits in a counter value is 32.
</p>

<p>
    You can have up to 64 counters in one account.
